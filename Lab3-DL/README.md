# Lab 3: Deep Learning

This lab and the accompanying lecture answer the questions "What is deep learning?", "What makes it different from other kinds of machine learning?" and "How do you _do_ deep learning?".

The main takeaway and learning outcome is that 
> Deep learning is a search for good hierarchical representations...

...that makes a given task easy to solve. We aim to get everyone on board with this description of deep learning and to indicate why and when deep learning can be useful. I will also provide hands-on experience with how this translates into computer code (using PyTorch) via some concrete, simple examples. 

We'll also look at some recent developments in deep learning and how they are&mdash;or can be&mdash;applied in medicine.
