# ELMED219: Artificial intelligence and computational medicine

The [course](https://www.uib.no/en/course/ELMED219) is offered by the [Department of Biomedicine](https://www.uib.no/biomedisin) in collaboration with the [Department of Computer science, Electrical engineering, and Mathematical sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en/about/management/faculty-of-engineering-and-science/department-of-computer-science-electrical-engineering-and-mathematical-sciences-ny-side), Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, and the [Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Center](https://mmiv.no/).

During the course, you will gain insight into computationally oriented thinking, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and an understanding of the pros and cons of AI for the future of medicine. The course provides a guided tour through some biomedical and clinical applications of mathematical and statistical modeling techniques, as well as principles for selected sensors and measuring instruments in research and clinical practice.


We meet concepts such as **big data**, **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **artificial intelligence (AI)**, with examples from personalized and predictive medicine. You will use methods and tools from numerical programming, data analysis, and "scientific computing" for medical applications, and learn about the importance of **open science**, **data sharing**, **reproducible research**, and **ethics by/in/for design** [[link](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ethics-by-design-and-ethics-of-use-approaches-for-artificial-intelligence_he_en.pdf)]

This repository contains most of the course material. Students enrolled in the course will also find some practical information at [MittUiB](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/33274).

A presentation and reflection on the course (aimed for the "**Kunstig intelligens i norsk helsetjeneste** ([KIN](https://ehealthresearch.no/kin))" network meeting, February 8th 2022) is found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ2goLSZsIjeCQrjUnA4lfnXe2wgsgDpUXWe8be4K_pTqo4OD9qELxDlJyKknYVdCjJ34-Q4gcu-yYx/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
